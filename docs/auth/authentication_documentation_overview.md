# RealNet API Authentication Documentation Overview

This document provides an overview of the authentication documentation available for implementing user authentication via the RealNet API using username and password.

## Available Documentation

The following documents are available to guide you through implementing authentication:

### 1. [User Authentication Implementation Guide](user_authentication_implementation_guide.md)

**Primary Reference Document**

This comprehensive guide provides detailed instructions for implementing user authentication via the RealNet API. It includes:

- Complete implementation steps
- Detailed code examples in JavaScript and Python
- Security best practices
- Troubleshooting tips
- Advanced topics

Use this as your main reference for implementing authentication.

### 2. [API Authentication Guide](api_authentication_guide.md)

**Quick Reference**

This concise guide focuses on the API endpoints and request/response formats for authentication. It includes:

- Authentication flow overview
- Endpoint reference
- Basic code examples
- Error handling

Use this for quick reference when you need to check endpoint details or basic implementation patterns.

### 3. [Authentication Debugging Guide](authentication_debugging_guide.md)

**Troubleshooting Reference**

This guide focuses on diagnosing and resolving common authentication issues. It includes:

- Potential authentication issues and their symptoms
- Diagnostic logging suggestions
- Common issues and solutions
- Advanced debugging techniques

Use this when you encounter issues with your authentication implementation.

## Authentication System Overview

The RealNet platform uses a robust authentication system based on OAuth 2.0 with support for multiple authentication methods:

- Username/password authentication
- OAuth2 authentication with external providers
- Token-based authentication for API access

### Key Components

1. **Authentication Endpoints**:
   - `/<org_name>/login` - For username/password authentication
   - `/oauth/token` - For token refresh
   - `/logout` - For ending sessions

2. **Token Types**:
   - Access tokens (short-lived, used for API requests)
   - Refresh tokens (long-lived, used to obtain new access tokens)

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   1. Client sends credentials to authentication endpoint
   2. Server validates credentials and issues tokens
   3. Client uses access token for API requests
   4. Client refreshes token when it expires

## Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure you've implemented all necessary components:

- [ ] User credential collection (username/password form)
- [ ] Authentication request to `/<org_name>/login` endpoint
- [ ] Secure token storage
- [ ] Authorization header inclusion in API requests
- [ ] Token expiration handling
- [ ] Token refresh implementation
- [ ] Logout functionality
- [ ] Error handling for authentication failures

## Security Considerations

When implementing authentication, keep these security considerations in mind:

1. **Always use HTTPS** for all API requests
2. **Store tokens securely** using appropriate storage mechanisms
3. **Implement proper token lifecycle management**
4. **Validate all user inputs** before sending to the API
5. **Handle authentication errors** gracefully without exposing sensitive information
6. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent brute force attacks

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered in the documentation:

1. Check the [Authentication Debugging Guide](authentication_debugging_guide.md) for common issues and solutions
2. Review the server logs for error messages
3. Contact the RealNet support team for assistance
