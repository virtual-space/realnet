# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initial system documentation and architecture analysis. Establishing baseline understanding of system components and relationships.

## Recent Changes
1. Memory Bank initialization
2. System architecture documentation
3. Technical context establishment
4. Project requirements definition

## Active Considerations

### Architecture
- Multiple provider implementations (SQL, AWS, Generic, File)
- Resource type system (Files, Forms, Views, Apps)
- Runner architecture (HTTP, SQS)
- Command-line interface structure

### Development
- Environment configuration
- Deployment options
- Security implementation
- Integration patterns

### Documentation
- System architecture
- Setup procedures
- Configuration requirements
- Deployment guides

## Current Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. Provider-based Storage
   - Multiple backend support
   - Abstract provider interface
   - Storage agnostic operations

2. Resource Management
   - Type-based resources
   - File handling
   - Form processing
   - View rendering

3. Runner System
   - Protocol abstraction
   - HTTP and SQS support
   - Template handling
   - Static file serving

4. Command Interface
   - Modular commands
   - Consistent CLI
   - Server management
   - Authentication handling

### Implementation Decisions
1. Technology Stack
   - Python-based implementation
   - PostgreSQL database
   - AWS services integration
   - Docker/Kubernetes support

2. Security Approach
   - Token-based authentication
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Secure credential management
   - Access control implementation

3. Deployment Strategy
   - Multiple deployment options
   - Container support
   - Environment isolation
   - Service configuration

This context will be updated as development progresses and new decisions are made.
